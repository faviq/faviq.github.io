Various improvements were made by many other inventors, until General Electric introduced \"fluorescent lumiline lamps\" commercially in 1938, first available to the public at the 1939 World's Fair. LED lamps also have a long history, with the first light-emitting diode (LED) invented in 1927 by Oleg Losev. LEDs were initially of low brightness, and have been used as indicator lamps and seven-segment displays since 1968. It wasn't until the development of high efficiency blue LEDs by Shuji Nakamura in the 1980s that white LEDs for lighting applications became practical. Although higher cost than incandescent light bulbs, LEDs have higher efficiency and longer life and may finally displace light bulbs in general lighting applications. In each case, more than 50 years passed between the initial invention and commercial success in general lighting applications."}, "div": "r_set"}, {"id": 731, "claim": "Green bay beat the bears 12 times in the 2010s.", "label": "REFUTES", "question": "how many times has green bay beat the bears in the 2010s?", "answer": "12", "positive_evidence": {"id": "23805554", "title": "1939 NFL season", "text": "The Western Division race was between the Lions, Bears and Packers.

Maya is shocked when Rick moves her into the Forrester mansion and replaces a portrait of deceased matriarch Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery) with a portrait of Maya instead. As Maya gloats about her victory, she is reminded that Rick has yet to profess his love for her. Thanks to Maya's insistence, Rick confesses his love for her and flaunts the relationship to Caroline. Bill resorts to threats again as Maya reluctantly welcomes her younger sister Nicole (Reign Edwards) into her life. Despite feeling uneasy at times, Maya continuously supports Rick as he spirals out of control manipulating and belittling Aly and even going so far as to shoot at Ridge and Caroline when he finds them kissing. Meanwhile, Nicole blackmails dangling a major secret over her head in exchange for several perks. With Carter's help, Maya learns Nicole has dropped out of college and tries to use it as leverage against her sister. However, Maya is stunned when Nicole confronts Maya about the fact that she is transgender. Maya confesses all to Nicole including that her daughter was actually Jesse's child whom Maya had gained custody of before being sent to prison. Though Nicole pressures her to confess, Maya warns that she needs to make that decision for herself. Maya is terrified when an angry Carter confronts her about being transgender having overheard a confrontation with Nicole and threatens to expose her. Maya apologizes for not being honest with him and talks Carter down. Later, Maya promises to come clean if Rick proposes. Maya is rightfully concerned when Nicole starts spending time with Bill's son Wyatt (Darin Brooks) and Nicole admits that she confided in Wyatt about Maya being transgender. As the gossip spreads throughout the company, Rick's mother Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) demands that Maya come clean with her son immediately. Rick finally proposes in a romantic mountain getaway and Maya makes her confession as Bill leaks the news to the press. When Maya believes Rick is embarrassed by her, she runs away in her car and Rick follows. As Maya questions if Rick still wants to marry her over the phone, the call disconnects leading Maya to believe Rick has rejected her. Maya resigns from her modeling position and hides out in her apartment where she reconciles with Nicole who apologizes for trusting Wyatt. As Maya is about to leave town for good, Rick tells her wants to be with her and she thanks him for defending her against Bill. After Rick is ousted as CEO by Ridge and his children, the public outcry for Maya's return leads to them both returning to the company. Maya is very uneasy when her parents, Vivienne (Anna Maria Horsford) and Julius (Obba Babatund\u00e9) come to rescue Nicole from Maya's influence. Maya becomes the central figure of the company's \"California Freedom\" line and Rick proposes to her during the fashion show and she happily accepts. On her wedding day, Maya is devastated when she overhears Julius referring to the event as a \"freak show\" and Maya has second thoughts. But Nicole convinces her to enjoy her day despite Julius. Maya confronts Julius at the altar and when he admits he has not accepted Maya's transition, she ask him to leave while Vivienne stays behind. Maya and Rick are happily married on August 12, 2015. After their honeymoon, Rick and Maya settle into married life and confides in him that she's ready to start a family. Instead of adoption, Maya asks Nicole to be their surrogate so the child will be both a Forrester and an Avant. The couple are ecstatic when Nicole agrees to the surrogacy but Julius and Vivienne disapprove fearing it will ruin Nicole's budding romance with Rick's nephew, Zende Forrester (Rome Flynn)."}, "negative_evidence": {"id": "434051", "title": "Cynthia J.

In 1905, a second trolley line, the Jersey Shore and Antes Fort Railway, was put into service between the city and the Pennsylvania Railroad station in Antes Fort, to the southeast. These two trolley lines changed Jersey Shore from a city with no railroad connection to a city with two. What had formerly been a minor stop on the West Branch Canal and stagecoach lines was transformed into an industrial boomtown. Over 1,000 skilled mechanics were employed at the car shops.

In that way, political economy expanded the emphasis of economics, which comes from the Greek \"oikos\" (meaning \"home\") and \"nomos\" (meaning \"law\" or \"order\"). Political economy was thus meant to express the laws of production of wealth at the state level, just as economics was the ordering of the home. The phrase \"\u00e9conomie politique\" (translated in English as \"political economy\") first appeared in France in 1615 with the well-known book by Antoine de Montchr\u00e9tien, \"Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019economie politique\". The French physiocrats were the first exponents of political economy, although the intellectual responses of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, David Ricardo, Henry George and Karl Marx to the physiocrats generally receives much greater attention. The world's first professorship in political economy was established in 1754 at the University of Naples Federico II in southern Italy. The Neapolitan philosopher Antonio Genovesi was the first tenured professor. In 1763, Joseph von Sonnenfels was appointed a Political Economy chair at the University of Vienna, Austria. Thomas Malthus, in 1805, became England's first professor of political economy, at the East India Company College, Haileybury, Hertfordshire.

Transmissivity is usually the same from both first and second surfaces.

For transmissive mirrors, such as one-way mirrors, beam splitters, or laser output couplers, the transmissivity of the mirror is an important consideration. The transmissivity of metallic coatings are often determined by their thickness. For precision beam-splitters or output couplers, the thickness of the coating must be kept at very high tolerances to transmit the proper amount of light. For dielectric mirrors, the thickness of the coat must always be kept to high tolerances, but it is often more the number of individual coats that determine the transmissivity.

He shifted his capital from Giringer to Valabhipur, near Bhavnagar, on Saurashtra's east coast. The Maitrakas of Vallabhi became very powerful with their rule prevailing over large parts of Gujarat and adjoining Malwa. A university was set up by the Maitrakas, which came to be known far and wide for its scholastic pursuits and was compared with the noted Nalanda University.

Although they initially dislike one another, The Atom and Aquaman eventually bond and succeed in their mission. In \"Game Over for Owlman!\" The Atom and other heroes hunt down Batman after being deceived by Owlman into believing that he had committed several crimes. Owlman and his allies eventually capture The Atom, along with a number of other heroes, and subject him to a device designed to kill him through use of an accelerated lead atom. The Atom is eventually freed by a western styled Batman and, in the ensuing melee, helps defeat Doctor Polaris. He makes a cameo appearance in \"Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!\" battling the Bug-Eyed Bandit on Aquaman's windshield before the windshield wipers wipe them off. In \"Sword of the Atom,\" Ryan Choi had retired from being Atom when Aquaman comes to him at the time when Chronos has returned. Ryan and Aquaman go to South America where Batman went missing looking for Ray Palmer. After helping to defeat Chancellor Deraegis, Ryan returns to being Atom while Ray remains in the Amazon.
