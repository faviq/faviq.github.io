In Mexico, several social democratic governments and presidents were elected from the 1920s to the 1930s. The most important Mexican social democratic government of this time was that led by President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas and the Party of the Mexican Revolution, whose government initiated agrarian reform that broke up vast aristocratic estates and redistributed property to peasants. C\u00e1rdenas was deeply committed to social democracy, but he was criticised by his left-wing opponents for being pro-capitalist due to his personal association with a wealthy family and for being corrupt due to his government's exemption from agrarian reform of the estate held by former Mexican president \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n. Political violence in Mexico had become serious in the 1920s with the Cristero War in which right-wing reactionary clericals fought against the left-wing government that was attempting to institute secularisation of Mexico. Furthermore, Cardenas' government openly supported Spain's Republican government while opposing Francisco Franco's Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War. During the Spanish Civil War, C\u00e1rdenas staunchly asserted that Mexico was progressive and socialist, working with socialists of various types\u2014including communists\u2014and accepting refugees from Spain as well as accepting communist dissident Leon Trotsky as a refugee after Joseph Stalin expelled Trotsky and sought to have him killed. C\u00e1rdenas strengthened the rights of Mexico's labour movement, nationalised foreign oil companies and controversially supported peasants in their struggle against landlords by allowing them to form militias to fight the private armies of landlords in the country. C\u00e1rdenas' actions deeply aggravated right-wing reactionaries and there was fear that Mexico would succumb to civil war.

Many wealthy Mexican families already owned huge estates, resulting in landless peasants working on the property as virtual slaves.

Demands for \"land and liberty\" motivated peasants in Morelos to rebel under the leadership of Emiliano Zapata. The Zapatistas confiscated estates and distributed land to peasants to pursue subsistence agriculture. Madero's failure to move on land reform during 1911-13 was a key reason the Zapata rebelled against him under the Plan of Ayala (1911).

Watson One might consider the experiment Watson and his assistant Rosalie Rayner carried out to be one of the most controversial in psychology in 1920. It has become immortalized in introductory psychology textbooks as the Little Albert experiment. The goal of the experiment was to show how principles of, at the time recently discovered, classical conditioning could be applied to condition fear of a white rat into \"Little Albert\", a 9-month-old boy. Watson and Rayner conditioned \"Little Albert\" by clanging an iron rod when a white rat was presented. First, they presented to the boy a white rat and observed that he was not afraid of it. Second, they presented him with a white rat and then clanged an iron rod. \"Little Albert\" responded by crying. This second presentation was repeated several times. Finally, Watson and Rayner presented the white rat by itself and the boy showed fear. Later, in an attempt to see if the fear transferred to other objects, Watson presented Albert with a rabbit, a dog, and a fur coat. He cried at the sight of all of them. This study demonstrated how emotions could become conditioned responses. As the story of \"Little Albert\" has made the rounds, inaccuracies and inconsistencies have crept in, some of them even due to Watson himself. Analyses of Watson's film footage of Albert suggest that the infant was mentally and developmentally disabled. An ethical problem of this study is that Watson and Rayner did not uncondition \"Little Albert\". In 2009, Beck and Levinson found records of a child, Douglas Merritte, who seemed to have been Little Albert. They found that he had died from congenital hydrocephalus at the age of 6. Thus, it cannot be concluded to what extent this study had an effect on \"Little Albert\"'s life. On 25 January 2012, Tom Bartlett of \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" published a report that questions whether John Watson knew of cognitive abnormalities in Little Albert that would greatly skew the results of the experiment. In 2014, however, the journals that initially endorsed Beck and Fridlund's claims about Albert and Watson (the \"American Psychologist\" and \"History of Psychology\") published articles debunking those claims ", "title": "John B.

In humans, conditioned fear is often measured with verbal report and galvanic skin response. In other animals, conditioned fear is often measured with freezing (a period of watchful immobility) or fear potentiated startle (the augmentation of the startle reflex by a fearful stimulus). Changes in heart rate, breathing, and muscle responses via electromyography can also be used to measure conditioned fear. A number of theorists have argued that conditioned fear coincides substantially with the mechanisms, both functional and neural, of clinical anxiety disorders.

Through exploring the theme of being black in America, Marshall\u2019s work also explores race in context with the \u201cCivil Rights Movement, Black Power Movement, housing projects, black beauty, and the political and social invisibility of blacks\u201d. Marshall\u2019s work was heavily influenced by his upbringing in Birmingham, Alabama in the 1950s and LA in the 1960s. His works were always based on the experience of being black in America during these time periods. Marshall created comic strips, such as Rythm Mastr which was a story of an African American teenager who gained superpowers through African sculptures using drum patterns. Marshall was concerned with the lack of African American heroes kids could look up to while growing up. He was one of the many African American artists who tried to incorporate themes of race and being black into his works. Often times Marshall\u2019s works were perceived to be full of emotion portraying what it was like being an Urban African American. His works displayed middle-class African American homes and families. One of his most famous series of works The Lost Boys (1993-1995) displays the lives of and issues many African Americans faced. The series of portraits was of young African American boys from the shoulder up, with very dark skin tones, which contrasted with extreme whiteness of the subject's eyes which was common in Marshall\u2019s works.

Hanako Muraoka, the Japanese woman who translated \"Anne of Green Gables\" into Japanese, has become a celebrity in her own right solely for translating the book, and in 2014 NHK aired a television mini-series titled \"Hanako to Anne\" about Muraoka's life and her struggle to get \"Anne of Green Gables\" translated and published in Japan. Muraoka read \"Anne of Green Gables\" in 1939 and started translating the book the same year, but it until 1952 that her translation of \"Anne of Green Gables\" was finally published in Japan. \"Hanako to Anne\" which aired between March\u2013September 2014 was a great rating success, getting an average of 22% viewership in the Kanto region (the most populous part of Japan), and caused a doubling of Japanese tourists to Prince Edward island. The series, which starred Yuriko Yoshitaka as Muraoka, suggested that there were many parallels between Muraoka's life and Anne's, and thus was a sort of retelling of Anne's life in the late Meiji, Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods of Japanese history. In 1993, a theme park called Canadian World opened in Hokkaido whose most popular attraction was a reproduction of Green Gables. In 2010, the \"Globe and Mail\" wrote: \"It could almost be declared that Anne's true home isn't rural Prince Edward Island any more. It's Japan, where Lucy Maud Montgomery's tale of Anne and her pigtailed innocence remains so popular that it has become ingrained in the national consciousness since the book's original Japanese translation as \"Red-Haired Anne\" in 1952.\" In 2014, the Japanese diplomat Eiji Yamamoto told a journalist from the \"Toronto Star\": \"Even though she's an orphan, Anne is a free spirit, she says anything she wants.

When it came to the national aspirations of the Zionist movement, the Ottoman Empire opposed the idea of Jewish self-rule in Palestine, fearing it might lose control of Palestine after recently having lost other territories to various European powers. It also took issue with the Jews, as many came from Russia, which sought the empire's demise. In 1881 the Ottoman governmental administration (the Sublime Porte) decreed that foreign Jews could immigrate to and settle anywhere within the Ottoman Empire, except in Palestine and from 1882 until their defeat in 1918, the Ottomans continuously restricted Jewish immigration and land purchases in Palestine. In 1882, Jews were banned from their Four Holy Cities and in 1891, after briefly allowing some Jewish immigration three years earlier, the Turkish rulers tried to again close the empire to Russian Jews. In 1892, the Ottoman government decided to prohibit the sale of land in Palestine to Jews, even if they were Ottoman citizens.

Players on this list have all recorded 30\u00a0or more rebounds in a single game. The NCAA did not split into its current divisions format until August 1973. From 1906 to 1955, there were no classifications to the NCAA nor its predecessor, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). Then, from 1956 to 1973, colleges were classified as either \"NCAA University Division (Major College)\" or \"NCAA College Division (Small College)\". Additionally, the NCAA recognizes two different eras in college basketball history when it comes to the statistic of rebounding: the pre-1973 era and the post-1973 era. In the pre-1973 era (otherwise known as the era before the divisional setup), opponents may have been less talented and from smaller schools (such as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics [NAIA] or Divisions II and III in today's classification). Although the 1972\u201373 season was before the divisional split, the NCAA officially considers that season to be \"post-1973\" because of the adoption of freshman eligibility for varsity play in all NCAA sports effective in August 1972. Therefore, the all-time single game rebound record is 51, set by Bill Chambers of William & Mary in 1953. Chambers' 51-rebound effort contributed to a Virginia state record of 100\u00a0team rebounds by the Tribe against UVA. The post-1973 era record is 35, set by Fresno State's Larry Abney on February 17, 2000. Abney's modern-day record has never seen any real challenge to be broken; the closest another player has come were 30-rebound efforts by Rashad Jones-Jennings of Arkansas\u2013Little Rock in 2005 and Kendall Gray of Delaware State in 2015.", "title": "List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 30 or more rebounds in a game"}, "negative_evidence": {"id": "20658721", "text": "List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season rebounding leaders Charlie Slack of Marshall owns the Division\u00a0I record for a single-season rebounding average (25.6), which he accomplished in 1954\u201355.

In the official NCAA men's basketball record books, a distinction is drawn between the pre-1973 era and the post-1973 era. One reason is that because of the split into the three Divisions in use today (Divisions I, II and III), many of the rebounds accumulated in the pre-1973 era were against less\u2013talented opponents that would be considered Division II, III or even NAIA in today's hierarchy.

Ludwig II was said to be the first Elector in the Holy Roman Empire who openly avowed the basic teachings of the Reformation. Not only did he promote every theologian who was prepared to reform the church, but he also saw the promotion of schooling as being an integral part of the Reformation, for Martin Luther himself had demanded of mayors and aldermen as early as 1524 the establishment and maintenance of Christian schools, a task that would fall to clergymen. \u201cOnly he who truly knew Christian teaching could in Luther\u2019s perception be a good Christian.\u201d Bearing this in mind, it seemed obvious that the task of raising these good Christians would be easier if children learnt to read, write, sing and pray. Thus, even in the Reformation\u2019s earliest days, schools were opened in the duchy\u2019s towns and all children had to attend. Successes were, however, moderate, for the need for reading and writing was not readily understood by many subjects, for the children\u2019s fathers, grandfathers and forebears had got along without them quite well in pre-Reformation times, never having undergone the burdensome training now being demanded of the children. For the actual purpose of establishing these schools, much can be read into how the teachers were, as a rule, also candidates for clerical posts, and were sent to teach children outside their own towns. The expansion of the school system was carried out only slowly. To Duke Johannes I\u2019s (ruled 1569-1604) way of thinking, children should be taught not only the beliefs of their faith (Catechism), but also reading, writing and \u201cother good arts\u201d. In a circular, therefore, he ordered that a school be set up in every parish seat where there was yet to be any schoolmaster or schoolroom, with the local pastor, failing either of those things, teaching the local children if need be. Since Konken was the local parish seat for Herschweiler-Pettersheim \u2013 that is to say, that was where everyone went to church \u2013 all the parish\u2019s children, and hence also the ones from Herschweiler and Pettersheim, had to attend school in Konken. For the winter of 1575-1576, Benedikt Reichhold from Waidenburg (Mei\u00dfen) is named as the pastor and the schoolmaster, while from 1579 to 1589, Nikolaus Schlemmer from Landstuhl is named as the holder of that post; he was then released from it at his own request. Johann Sebastian Armbruster was likewise both the pastor and the schoolmaster in Konken (with Pfeffelbach and Niederkirchen) from 1592 to 1597. These clergymen, who had to pray not only on Sunday but also throughout the week and also work the parish land, put up a fight against all this extra work with all kinds of excuses. In 1596, the Duke instructed his officials to force the clergy to hold school, and to introduce new schools into 46 further villages. By the time Duke Johannes I died on 12 August 1604, though, thirty places in his realm had schools taught by secular schoolteachers, while in eight further places, schools temporarily had ecclesiastical schoolteachers. This school policy was also maintained by Johannes I\u2019s successor, Duke Johannes II, who ruled from 1604 to 1635. The pastors, who had to see to the schoolmasters\u2019 maintenance, felt that this extra work was unreasonable, especially as they thereby also had to put up with a reduction of earnings. It could be that this measure was undertaken to offset the reduction in the amount of work that the schoolmasters represented. Meanwhile, certain sectors of the population had come to believe that a school was not an utter disadvantage for the village. The cost of building a schoolroom and the people\u2019s poverty, though, further dampened interest in establishing a school. Besides, the villagers would soon have something else to worry about, for the Thirty Years' War was about to break out. This war saw to it that many villages almost died right out, and therefore had no further need for a school. During reconstruction from 1661 to 1681, only five of Herschweiler-Pettersheim\u2019s pre-war families actually came back to the village, in 1670. It is clear that school began again in this time, for a schoolmaster for Konken is named for 1671, Kaspar Metzger. Schoolmasters changed often from year to year, with the pastor sometimes taking on the duty between teachers. Daniel Fischer, who had been teaching in Konken since 1692, left the village schoolhouse in 1694, went to Altenglan and stayed there until 1699, when he came back to Konken, only to leave for Altenglan again in 1702. Besides his meagre wages, the schoolmaster received an agreed amount of produce, grain, oats and wine. Most of the produce, though, was not delivered, and the money was also not paid, which was of course the cause of frequent complaints. The subjects, too, often complained, mainly about how they were too poor to pay a schoolmaster. The Reformed school assistant Valentin Me\u00dfing, who taught from 1720 to 1729 in \"Conken\" (as it was spelt in those days) complained in 1731 that he had not been paid since Saint Martin\u2019s Day (11 November) 1730. He was owed half a barrel of grain by each \"Gemeindsmann\" (male citizen). From the same year came news that \u201cthe villages of Langenbach and Herschweiler together with Pfettersheim\u201d were building schoolhouses and wanted to hire their own schoolteacher. They eventually hired a school assistant later in the year, who nevertheless had to \u201cfeed\u201d himself. This was the beginning of the split from the Konken school. The official severing of the link came in 1733. At the time, Herschweiler-Pettersheim counted 14 \u201cReformed citizens\u201d. Named as teacher at the local winter school (a school geared towards an agricultural community\u2019s practical needs, held in the winter, when farm families had a bit more time to spare) for 1737-1738 was Johann Georg Dentzer, who was born in Annweiler am Trifels. Church steward Koch had to break it to the municipality that \u201cif they want to keep their own school assistant, they should maintain him without burdening the administration\u201d. Thus, each \"Gemeindsmann\" was to yield up half a barrel of grain and one \"Simmer\" (roughly 22\u00a0L) of oats, and further, each one was to pay 8 to 15 Rhenish guilders. Teaching here in 1743 was the old schoolmaster Conrad Fuhr, and from 1744 to 1745 it was Johann Georg Ott. Thereafter, Gottfried Holl from Zweibr\u00fccken was named as the poor, abandoned school assistant at Herschweiler-Petersheim. Although the municipality had already gathered up 10 barrels of corn by the time Holl took the job, he only got 6\u00bd. Following in 1752 was Mateus Lozenius, and about 1771 came Philipp Heinrich Collini, who in 1778 received a sharp rebuke for his behaviour, and in 1783 he had to switch posts with the Adenbach teacher Pra\u00df, because the Reverend Heintz from Konken had reported Pra\u00df for apparently visiting an inn, getting drunk and then proceeding to the dance floor. Teaching candidate Philipp Venter followed in 1795, and then sometime between 1796 and 1800 came Christian Pra\u00df. In 1825, schoolteacher Kaiser, who complained about how small his lodgings were, was transferred. He was followed by schoolteacher Gl\u00f6ckner, school administrator Fau\u00df (1836-1837) and a schoolteacher named Klensch. In 1822, the municipality\u2019s very first schoolhouse \u2013 formerly A. Clemens\u2019s property \u2013 had to be expanded by having a parlour added. In the winter half-year of 1826/1827, 95 children attended the school, while in the summer half-year it was 90. Since the school had become too small by 1829, it was auctioned. For the time being, a new schoolhouse could not be afforded, even though in 1828 a place had been measured out for it. The temporary solution was to move school in 1829 to Langenbach, where it was held in farmer Adam Feick\u2019s rented, two-floor farmhouse. Two years later, it was moved again, this time to Jakob Trapp\u2019s property. Eventually, in 1833, a new schoolhouse could be afforded. It was later to be used as a mayoral office and the municipal centre. In the winter half-year of 1841, 109 children attended the school, while in the summer half-year it was 114. The number of schoolchildren had risen by 1848 to 127, who were all taught by schoolteacher Klensch and his son as assistant. Obviously the municipality wanted to know nothing about this assistant\u2019s additional salary. Even the Royal Bavarian government did not approve the second teaching post upon which the school commission had decided, leaving everyone to make the best of a questionable situation. As a result of rising pupil numbers, the municipality bought forester\u2019s assistant Kirsch\u2019s house in 1856, which later also served as the municipal centre, and used it after the conversion, beginning in 1860, as a second schoolhouse. In 1874, Karl D\u00f6rr came to Herschweiler. He complained about the school conditions and requested a new building, which at first municipal council refused. Knowing that the teacher\u2019s post in Kusel was far better (and therefore made the municipality look bad), a new schoolhouse was built in 1879 on the former Stegner property. The two schoolhouses standing next to each other, with a teacher\u2019s dwelling, allowed orderly schooling. In 1905, at the business association\u2019s request, a \"Zeichenschule\" (a kind of early vocational school for training craftsmen) was established for apprentices and local business owners\u2019 sons, although this only lasted until 21 October 1914, when it was closed for want of students and because times were bad for craft industries (this was likely due to the outbreak of the First World War a few months earlier). It was headed by the Bavarian schoolteacher Karl Baumbach, who had been teaching since 1882. He had also pressed the municipality for a new building, but municipal council had refused, even in the face of a majority being in favour of it at a citizens\u2019 meeting. In 1909, the building now known as \u201cthe old schoolhouse\u201d \u2013 since 2004, in renovated form, the municipal centre \u2013 was built with four classrooms. Uninterrupted teaching continued there for only five years before the First World War broke out, and the teachers were called into the Kaiser\u2019s forces. At first, the school simply had to be closed, but later it was run by assistant teachers taking turns with the school in Langenbach, and also with mixed-grade classes. Henceforth, schoolwork was characterized by the course of the war. Owing to petroleum shortages, classes had to begin later, or they were cancelled for lack of heating fuel or because there were public works that the teachers had to perform outside school. School was also cancelled owing to military demands: French prisoners of war were sometimes billeted there; the schoolhouse was used as an army mess when the war ended, for soldiers on the way home; French occupiers quartered themselves there. In the autumn of 1922, the downstairs classrooms received \u201cfor the enlightenment of civic gatherings\u201d electric lighting, while the upstairs classrooms were left out owing to cost, leaving wintertime classes to be held with the old-fashioned petroleum lighting. On 2 November 1931, the school head applied to the regional school authority, asking for a stop to be put to the annoyances and obstacles due to the many jobless men who had to pick up their unemployment money here. After 1933, when Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seized power, the school joined in celebrations, torchlight parades and Party events. The lads from 4th to 7th grade from Herschweiler-Pettersheim and neighbouring villages met on the sporting ground in the Wallheck for sport competitions, while the girls held gymnastic demonstrations under the music club\u2019s leadership. On 22 March 1937, those entitled to education voted for the introduction of the German Christian Community School. What had hitherto been the \"Protestantische Volksschule Herschweiler-Pettersheim\" became the \"Deutsche Volksschule Herschweiler-Pettersheim\". That same year, the 8th grade and a fourth teaching post were introduced. As in the First World War, the end of the Second World War brought school cancellations owing to a lack of teachers, the conversion of the building into a Wehrmacht field hospital and, once again, French occupiers quartered themselves there, claiming three of the rooms in November 1945. Under the most difficult of circumstances, classes were begun again, provisorily, in September, and over the winter sometimes had to be held in unheated rooms. Until the spring of 1946, schoolteacher Klinck taught all classes, with grade levels combined. Only in 1950 was some normalcy restored, once there was a staff of four teachers again. On 29 September 1963, the foundation stone was laid for the sixth schoolhouse in the village\u2019s history, on the former sporting ground in the Wallheck. The dedication came on 20 November 1965. On 19 April 1966, \"Protestantische Volksschule Herschweiler-Pettersheim\" was declared a \"Mittelpunktschule\" (\u201cmidpoint school\u201d, a central school, designed to eliminate smaller outlying schools). In 1968, the municipalities of Albessen, Frohnhofen, Herchweiler, Herschweiler-Pettersheim, Konken, Krottelbach, Langenbach, Liebsthal, Ohmbach, Selchenbach and Wahnwegen were all grouped into the Herschweiler-Pettersheim School Association (\"Schulverband Herschweiler-Pettersheim\"). Grades were organized and some grades were \u201cfarmed out\u201d to school buildings elsewhere. This fragmentary arrangement got officials thinking about building a new school for the school association. With the formation of \"Verbandsgemeinden\" in 1972, these same bodies also became school zones, leading to a reorganization with regard to neighbouring villages. Glan-M\u00fcnchweiler as the \"Verbandsgemeinde\" seat and Herschweiler-Pettersheim as the biggest municipality by population were each given a Hauptschule department with a primary school organizationally bound thereto.

It begins with a flashback to Storm's pup days, when she was Lick and she and her brothers were sleeping with Martha one night whilst the wolfdog Alpha tried keeping an eye on them; despite the Alpha's prejudice toward Fierce Dogs, Lick registers that she and her brothers will always be safe and generally loved in this Wild Pack. Back in the present, a night has passed since Storm's return and imprisonment. She is brought out of the den to tell her side of the story to everyone, and as she begins to tell it, she sees Breeze beginning to lunge for Nibble and Storm impulsively launches herself at Breeze, and then suddenly realizes, as soon as she pins the traitor down, that Breeze only pretended to strike at Nibble just to get Storm provoked and look even more like she is the mindless killing bad dog. Storm is brought back to the den and Sweet continues to ponder others' suggestions of punishment. After waking up from a session of sleeping, Storm finds a hole opened up in the den's thornbush side and is tempted to leap through and leave the camp, but she understands, with Sunshine's help that Breeze made that gap to let Storm possibly escape and look guilty, so the gap is mended. She ponders for a while and now believes that when she brought Tumble down to the beach in a sleepwalking state during Long Light, she was actually trying to unconsciously protect him from the current pawn of the Fear-Dog, Breeze. At another point, she is visited by Twitch who wants to hear more from her case, and she asks him about how Breeze behaved in Terror's old Pack since Twitch briefly joined that Pack last year, and he says that he does recall Breeze acting strangely loyal to Terror, whatever he commanded; Twitch agrees with Storm that Rake's Pack will be visited for more answers about Breeze's past. At one point, Storm overhears Sunshine talking to others who believe Storm is innocent: Daisy, Sweet and even Tiny; so Sweet then tells Breeze that, even though they don't know who truly is the traitor, Breeze will be having help when babysitting the pups, a second adult dog to monitor her. The next day, Storm wakes up to find herself sleepwalking successfully out of her confinement and also finds that the camp is in an uproar, for the four pups are missing, and so is Breeze. Suddenly, Rake's Pack appears, with Woody specifically bringing the dead body of Ruff who they say was murdered last night; Dart accuses Storm of doing it, but is told by Lucky that Storm was confined in the Alpha den all night and that Breeze was the real killer of Ruff (since Ruff was apparently quite defiant of Terror back when she lived under his rule). Individual search parties made up of both Sweet's Pack and Rake's Pack go off to find Breeze and the pups, Storm specifically searching with Daisy, Beetle and Thorn. They follow the scent of the pups and find that it leads through a meadow that is now being dug up by longpaw-operated construction vehicles, and while they all try to casually move through the site without causing any negative suspicion to the longpaw men, Thorn and Beetle just attack anyway (still filled with longpaw prejudice because of their father's death) and Thorn ends up getting shot in one of her forelegs by one longpaw that is carrying a short silver loudstick (pistol), much to the negative feedback of his coworkers, so the team must cut their pups-and-Breeze-search short for now to bring Thorn back to camp for proper care (she is now damaged both physically and psychologically). Back at camp, Sunshine tends to Thorn's seriously fractured leg with wet moss, Moon is dreadfully concerned for her daughter's life, and Twitch advises Thorn to do what he did back when he had a broken forepaw, to chew off the entire foreleg. At sunset, all the search parties come back unsuccessful, but immediately a new search party is formed, consisting of Storm, Daisy, Lucky and Rake. Once night has fallen, the four track a familiar pup scent to the edge of a sheer cliff at the seashore and discover that Tiny is stuck on a rocky outcropping of sandstone on the side of the cliff. They rescue her and she says that her memory is fuzzy on what happened because she was so scared. Tiny is brought back to camp where she is greeted affectionately by everyone. The next day, a proper funeral is held for Ruff and then Tiny reveals to them all that her memories of what happened with her, her siblings, and Breeze are returning since she has calmed down: she reveals that Breeze said that she was taking the four of them on an adventure into the forest where they soon slept for the night in a hollow at the base of a tree, though Tiny herself woke up and began questioning Breeze's suspicious behavior, to which Breeze immediately revealed her evil intents and began tormenting Tiny, who eventually fell on that slab of stone on the side of the seaside cliff and Breeze believed she had died. Tiny also says that she was supposedly visited by the ghost of a female pup that bore a resemblance to her, and the description matches that of her deceased cousin Tufty. Just at that moment, Bella's Pack appears, looking for Storm since she has been absent for 10 days now. So many (except Dart and Chase, who are later disciplined by the Packs' leaders for making false accusations as if the two have learned nothing) are glad to see them again (Nip and Scramble are happy to finally meet their Uncle Lucky and one of their cousins, Tiny), and the three Packs agree that they will have to work together to save Nibble, Tumble and Fluff from Breeze's madness - they find that they should also find enough prey since those nearby longpaw construction workers seem to be scaring off suitable prey in the area. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, the wailing calls of the lost pups are heard and search parties spread out, Storm joining Mickey, Rake and Daisy, who try to follow the calls, but they seem to come from nowhere and everywhere, and so the four of them decide to huddle together in sleep for the rest of the night and continue their search in the morning. Storm soon wakes up in the early dawn to see the same Golden Deer buck she saw when she first left Sweet's Pack and pursues him; she does not catch him, but he leads her to a verdant sloping cliff cat the edge of the Endless Lake, and here she hears the calls of the lost pups, coming from some kind of subterranean tunnel beneath the slope, so she calls over Mickey, Rake and Daisy, and soon the other search parties show up too (Sweet has to stay behind to look after both Tiny and Thorn). They can hear the panicked calls of Fluff and Tumble, but not Nibble. With help from Nip and Scramble (who loosen a big flat slab of stone), Storm and Lucky enter down into the underground tunnel system to seek out Fluff and Tumble \u2013 they also must hurry since the close by construction worker longpaws and their construction loudcages are approaching this seaside area, unwittingly causing tremors that could make the cavernous tunnels here collapse. Storm and Lucky find them in a small corner of the cavern and they head out through the passage Breeze had brought them through to get the two pups down there. Once back at camp, Tumble and Fluff tell everyone that Breeze had told them and Nibble that Tiny had died and that they were going to go exploring underground to possibly meet the Earth-Dog, and Breeze herself was acting very odd; soon she revealed to them her evil intentions and told them to stay in the cave for there could be monsters lurking about, but Nibble was not there with them in the cave because she was more scared to enter and thus Breeze took her away, seeing her as the perfect gift to sacrifice to the Fear-Dog in order to make up for the \"insult\" Storm had caused from killing Terror, doing it soon, at the place where Terror died and on the night of the new moon - they also say about how the spirit of Tufty also visited them. Eventually, Storm, Lucky, Bella and Arrow head out into the forest to seek out Breeze and Nibble, looking for the location where Terror was killed by Storm. Along the way, they make it across a road, nearly getting killed by loudcages and loud-beasts (motorcycles). Soon, by nightfall, they come to a part of forest that has recently been altered by longpaws and is being worked into a small suburb, where they find it being guarded by three Rough Dogs (Rottweilers): two males named Brick and Brunt, and a female named Nail. These Rough Dogs say that Breeze came through here with Nibble, and she had claimed that Nibble was her pup and that Sweet's Pack was a bunch of liars, to which they are suddenly corrected by Storm, Lucky, Bella and Arrow, showing that Breeze lied to them. The seven good dogs then find that Breeze has brought Nibble to the top of an unfinished building and is preparing to sacrifice the pup to the Fear-Dog as a rainstorm suddenly commences. Bella and Storm rush up the unfinished building, and once at the top Bella directly fights Breeze, only to have Breeze knock her off the edge where she falls to the ground to her death. Nibble escapes the scene (the spirit of Tufty guiding her) and now Storm chases down Breeze to finish this once and for all - she briefly glimpses what appears to be apparitions of the Fear-Dog and the Watch-Dog staring each other down. They end up back on the ground outside the unfinished building and Storm now battles Breeze to the death, where the evil dog is choked to death by Storm's bite, her body lying in some spilt wet cement - the spirits of Whisper and Tufty congratulate Storm before returning to the Forest Beyond. Later at dawn, the skies clear and Storm, Lucky, Arrow, Nibble, Brick, Brunt and Nail dig a grave for Bella in the forest and her sad funeral commences. Storm, Arrow, Lucky and Nibble return to camp (the Rough Dogs chose to stay with their longpaws) and show to everyone that Nibble has been found, but Bella died trying to save her. They also learn that more construction worker longpaws have been sighted nearby, planning on clearing some of the trees close to the camp. It is agreed that the whole Pack of 22 (Rake's Pack and Arrow's Pack officially rejoining Sweet's Pack) must move on to find a new home, and Arrow recommends the mountains to the north, close to the territory of the Still-Water Pack of superstitious wolves, but where longpaws do not level the trees. Eventually, a whole month later, close to Ice Wind, up in their new mountain territory, the Pack hosts the Naming Ceremony for Sweet and Lucky's pups: Fluff becomes Earth, Nibble becomes Forest, Tumble becomes River, and Tiny becomes Sky \u2013 all in honor of the Earth-Dog, the Forest-Dog, the River-Dog and the Sky-Dogs. During this ceremony, Storm catches a glimpse of the spirits of all their deceased packmates (Alfie, Mulch, Fuzz, Wiggle, Fiery, Spring, Fang, Splash, Martha, Whisper, Bruno, Ruff, Bella, Tufty, and even the former Alpha wolfdog) visiting the now liberated Pack. A year later, everything is peaceful and there is no infighting amongst Sweet's Pack; they have managed to make an agreement with the neighboring Sill-Water Pack to look out for any invading longpaws (though the longpaws that do sometimes appear in the area are harmless hikers); Thorn is now three-legged like Twitch; Forest, Sky, Earth and River have trained to become excellent hunters and their two cousins, also becoming professional hunters, have now chosen their own Adult Names as well: Nip is now Tough (because of both his developing strength and the fact that the name sounds like his dead sister's name, Tufty) and Scramble is now Golden. Storm notices gray appearing on Lucky's muzzle and wonders how old he is now. She is told by Sweet that the Pack will need good leadership when the swift-dog herself is no longer the Alpha, hinting that Storm herself could become the Pack's next Alpha someday.", "title": "Survivors (novel series)"}, "div": "a_set"}, {"id": "1765", "claim": "don schlitz from mississippi wrote the song forever and ever amen.", "label": "REFUTES", "question": "who from mississippi wrote the song forever and ever amen?", "answer": "don schlitz", "positive_evidence": {"id": "7494129", "text": "Forever and Ever, Amen Forever and Ever, Amen\n\n\"Forever and Ever, Amen\" is a song written by Paul Overstreet and Don Schlitz, and recorded by American country music artist Randy Travis.

Oceanic crust is formed at sea-floor spreading centers, and continental crust is formed through arc volcanism and accretion of terranes through tectonic processes, though some of these terranes may contain ophiolite sequences, which are pieces of oceanic crust considered to be part of the continent when they exit the standard cycle of formation and spreading centers and subduction beneath continents. Oceanic crust is also denser than continental crust owing to their different compositions. Oceanic crust is denser because it has less silicon and more heavier elements (\"mafic\") than continental crust (\"felsic\").

After killing Alice Hardy, Jason returns to Crystal Lake to guard it from all intruders. Five years later, a group of teenagers arrive at Crystal Lake to set up a new camp, but Jason murders them. Ginny Field (Amy Steel), the last counselor Jason attempts to kill, finds a cabin in the woods with a shrine built around the severed head of Mrs. Voorhees. Ginny fights back and slams a machete through Jason's shoulder. Jason is left for dead as Ginny is taken away in an ambulance. During the events of \"Friday the 13th Part III\" (1982), Jason (Richard Brooker) removes the machete from his shoulder and finds his way to Chris Higgins' (Dana Kimmell) local homestead. Chris returns to her property with some friends, and Jason kills anyone who wanders into the barn where he is hiding. Taking a hockey mask from a victim to hide his face, Jason leaves the barn to kill the rest of the group. Chris seemingly kills Jason with an axe to his head, but the night's events drive her into hysteria as the police take her away.", "title": "Friday the 13th (franchise)"}, "negative_evidence": {"id": "6610141", "text": "Friday the 13th Part III Writing for the \"Los Angeles Times\", Linda Gross wrote: \"Ironically, \"Friday the 13th Part 3\" is so terrible that \"Friday the 13th Part 1\" and \"Friday the 13th Part 2\" don't seem so bad.\" Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" stated that it \"would be a little better than \"Part I\" or \"Part II\" even without 3-D\".

He argues that in the four original Canadian provinces, the politics of taxation were a central issue in the debate about Confederation. Taxation was also central to the debate in Newfoundland, the tax-averse colony that rejected it. Smith argued Confederation was supported by many colonists who were sympathetic to a relatively interventionist, or statist, approach to capitalist development. Most classical liberals, who believed in free trade and low taxes, opposed Confederation because they feared it would result in Big Government. The struggle over Confederation involved a battle between a staunchly individualist economic philosophy and a comparatively collectivist view of the state's proper role in the economy. According to Smith, the victory of the statist supporters of Confederation over their anti-statist opponents prepared the way for Sir John A.

In the series finale, Joc Pederson hit a go-ahead homer in the seventh inning as the Dodgers extended their winning streak to a season high seven games with a 6\u20133 win. This was the Dodgers first four-game series sweep of the Mets since the 1979 season. The Dodgers continued their homestand with a three-game weekend series with the Colorado Rockies. Alex Wood allowed one run in six innings pitched, while Yasiel Puig homered and Justin Turner had three hits as the Dodgers beat the Rockies 6\u20131.

The Dodgers extended their winning streak to a season high 10 games, making it three straight series sweep, and the five runs scored on wild pitches was the most by any team since 1920.
