Other artists have experimented with different looks for Wonder Woman over the years, including an all-white mod jumpsuit, a biker outfit, a variation of her mainstream depiction featuring leather pants and a jacket, and a number of armoured battlesuits.

As a young girl, Diana met and befriended a young Arthur Curry. When they reach adulthood, they agree to a Marriage of convenience, wherein they will reveal their societies to the world at large together. On the day of their wedding, Hippolyta was killed by a spear thrown by an Atlantean. Unbeknownst to the bride or groom, Hippolyta's death was part of a scheme concocted by Ocean Master, Artemis and Wonder Woman's aunt, Penthesileia, to prevent the union of Aquaman and Wonder Woman (Diana was the intended target, but Hippolyta got in the way). In retaliation, Wonder Woman declares war on Atlantis. Aquaman and the Atlanteans then visit Themyscira to negotiate for peace, but Artemis has bombs dropped on Themyscira, with Wonder Woman angrily believing the Atlanteans were behind it. Wonder Woman's only option is to destroy Themyscira and then escape on the Amazon's invisible planes. She then leads the Amazons in conquering the United Kingdom, renaming it New Themyscira. Wonder Woman later catches Steve Trevor with her Lasso of Truth and begins interrogating him after he is temporarily able to resist the lasso's effects. Steve explains that he was hired to extract Lois Lane from New Themyscira because she was sent to gather information on the Amazons for Cyborg. Wonder Woman states that their counterspy was telling something similar to Cyborg's amassing of superhumans to stop the fighting between her and Aquaman. Her subjects ask her what to do with Steve. Later, Wonder Woman attacks the Resistance member Penny Black, but Penny shows her that people were imprisoned of internment by her aunt Penthesileia. Wonder Woman is furious and frees the people from internment, which she believes that they are not accepted for prison. During this same period, the Amazonian Furies attack the reinforcements of a group of Atlanteans sent to kill Terra, who was being used to keep New Themyscira in the air; Wonder Woman personally joins the battle, confronting the leader, Aquaman. During their struggle, she tells Aquaman that they have both been deceived, when she discovers that her aunt Penthesileia kissing Ocean Master are both responsible for the war between the Atlanteans and the Amazons, that was a ruse planned by them. While the Atlanteans are going to surface, but their attack having been backfired by Ocean Master, Aquaman believes Wonder Woman has set a trap. Wonder Woman escapes from Aquaman, who refuses her word. Wonder Woman then contacts the Amazons to defend their home. The battlefield of Wonder Woman and Aquaman are them fighting; however, they are both approached by the Flash and the heroes that are here to stop the war. Wonder Woman is struggled by Kal-El, who intends to attack her at the last battle."}, "div": "d_set"}, {"id": 45, "claim": "Ying yang twins recorded \"get low\" (which has lyrics saying \"to the window, to the wall\").", "label": "REFUTES", "positive_evidence": {"id": "25436777", "title": "Crunk", "text": "The song \"Get Low\" (2003), performed by Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz with the Ying Yang Twins, is credited as the track which put crunk music into the national spotlight. \"Get Low\" reached the number two position on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 music chart; overall, it spent more than 21 weeks in the charts.

Andy Serkis played Gollum by providing his voice and movements on set, as well as performing within the motion capture suit. His scenes were filmed twice, with and without him. Originally Gollum was set to solely be a CG character, but Jackson was so impressed by Andy Serkis' audition tape that they used him on set as well. A team led by Randy Cook performed the animation using both motion capture data and manual recreation of Serkis' facial reference. Gollum's CG model was also redesigned during 2001, now using a subdivision surface model instead of the NURBS model for \"Fellowship\" (a similar rebuild was also done for the digital doubles of the lead actors), when Serkis was cast as Sm\u00e9agol, Gollum's form before he is cursed by the One Ring, so as to give the impression that Andy Serkis as Sm\u00e9agol transforms into the CG Gollum. The original model can still be glimpsed briefly in the first film. Over Christmas 2001, the crew proceeded to reanimate all the previous shots accordingly within two months. Another problem was that the crew realized that the cast performed better in the versions of the film with Serkis. In the end, the CG Gollum was often animated on top of these scenes and Serkis would be painted out. Due to Gollum's not being human, shots such as him crawling down a sheer cliff were shot with no live reference. Serkis also did motion-capture for the character which would drive the body of the model, whilst animators did all fingers and facial animation. Gino Acevedo supervised realistic skin tones, which for the first time used subsurface scattering shader, taking four hours per frame to render. Render time refers to the amount of time it took the computer to process the image into a usable format; it does not include the amount of time it took the texture artists to \"draw\" the frame.

However, defensive lineman Michael Bennett was flagged for encroachment, which moved the ball out to the 6-yard line. When Brady attempted to take a knee to end the game, linebacker Bruce Irvin threw a closed hand punch at Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, starting a brawl involving players from both teams that resulted in an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for Seattle. In addition to the unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, Irvin was ejected from the game, making him the first player ever to be ejected from a Super Bowl. After the game, Irvin was fined $10,000.
